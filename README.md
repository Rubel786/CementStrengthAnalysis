# CementStrengthAnalysis
Prediction Modelling for Cement Compressive Strength

1. Here you have to create virtual environment first
2. Then you have to install all  necessary libraries

   Example:
   pip install flask
   pip install pandas
   pip install numpy
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install sklearn

3. Here we are using 8 columns as independent variable(eg. Ash_Component, Plastisizer etc)
4. Dependent variable as Compression_Strength
5. Random Forest Regressor becames the best predictive modelling for this data
6. Accuracy is too Low for this data ( 42% )
